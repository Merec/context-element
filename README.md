ContextElement
============

ContextElement is a jQuery plugin which allows you to add an element as context item to each HTML element you want. It was originally designed to extend [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) but it also runs as standalone.

Usage
------------
To easily add a context element to your item, add `data-toggle="contextElement"` to the element of your choice. Then add the `data-target` attribute with the ID or the class of the element that will be shown as context element.
```html
<a href="#" data-toggle="contextElement" data-target="#contextMenuExample" data-leftClick="true">Click me!</a>
```
